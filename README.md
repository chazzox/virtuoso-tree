<div align="center"><h1>virtuoso-tree</h1></div>

This is a light-weight library that enables users to efficiently render a tree data structure using React. Built on top of [react-virtuoso](https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso), heavily Inspired by [react-vtree](https://github.com/Lodin/react-vtree)

## What it should do
- render tree like data structures using the virtualisation library [react-virtuoso](https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso)

## Current Issues
- lacks functionality
- lacks documentation

## TODO:
- reverse engineer and rewrite the original code of [react-vtree](https://github.com/Lodin/react-vtree)
